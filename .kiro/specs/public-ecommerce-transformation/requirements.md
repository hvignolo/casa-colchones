# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing mattress admin application into a dual-purpose system: a public-facing e-commerce website for customers and a private admin dashboard for management. The public interface will follow the fashion e-commerce template design with orange/pink gradients (#ff5e3a primary color), rounded product cards, and modern responsive layout. The admin functionality will remain completely intact and accessible through a dedicated route.

## Requirements

5. WHEN a user clicks on a product card THEN the system SHALL navigate to the individual product detail page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view detailed information about a specific mattress, so that I can understand its features and calculate financing options.

#### Acceptance Criteria
